Welcome to the pBook demo!

Due to memory limits, books are broken up into parts, and I haven't gotten around to making a TOC function. Go to Part 2 to read Washington Irving's Rip van Winkle, or Part 6 for The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.

Navigation is pretty straightforward: The down button is page down, the up button is page up. Double-clicking up or down jumps to the top or bottom of the current part, and holding down either of them scrolls quickly. When you stop scrolling, the text will probably be misaligned, you can realign it using the select button to move down one row of pixels at a time; double-clicking it moves up one row of pixels.

When you reach the end of the part you're reading, simply use the back button to return to the menu and select the next part, then continue reading. If you want to take a break, just use the back button to exit and it'll save your place. When you come back, the part you were reading will be highlighted, and when you select it you'll be taken to the last page you were on.

If you'd like to compile your own pBooks, the source code can be found at github.com/MoTLD/pBook. It's ugly, and compiling books is kinda fiddly, but it works. Good luck, and have fun!
